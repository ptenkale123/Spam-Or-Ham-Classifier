## Spam or Ham Classifier- Project Description ##
This project is an ML Binary Classifier that predicts whether a message should be considered 'spam' or not. 
I implemented the Naive Bayes Algorithm and compared P(spam | {words}) and P(not spam | {words}).

Used the TF-IDF with Additive Smoothing to calculate word probabilites.

Dataset is available to view in './input/spam-or-ham/spam.csv'
